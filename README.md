# blinky-v2
A more complex version of Blinky with 3 LEDs total which cycle through each other blinking

At the moment this was more of a project about getting used to CMake, CLion and basic C++.

In the future I look to include functionality with the buttons which will allow for example button 1's button press to change which LEDs are flashing and Button 2's button to change the frequency of the flashing.

-> however i still need to understand how momentary push down buttons in a pull-down configuration fully work (One leg of button connected to GPIO pin and the other leg connected to ground).
